          <p><br>Hall of Fame is an interactive gallery and exhibit that focuses on combatting a problem that many are trying to solve - inactive kids and childhood obesity.
            Here at Hall of Fame we don't focus on what's good for you to eat - we focus on getting kids active! We want to introduce uncommon sports to you and your family,
            like parkour, NASCAR, archery, or rock-climbing.
            <br>
            We integrate technology and uncommon sports to try to pique the interest of inactive kids in something they have
            probably never been exposed to before. Our wide variety of activities caters to different levels of accessibility as well - previous levels of activity, financial
            situations, or equipment.<br><br></p>
